    <div class="site-title">Dear Sora,</div>
    <div class="message">We have been together for almost a month now (on the 20th) <br>
        and I just want to say that I love you so much more than you can ever imagine. <br>
        <br>
        Ever since we met you have made my life so much better. <br> 
        Every time I get a text from you it just makes my whole day, <br>
        no matter how bad my day was going before. <br>
        Every picture, voice message, and video (tt) you send, <br>
        just makes me feel so loved and cared for. <br>
        <br>
        And I am so thankful to have you in my life. <br>
        I know I can talk to you, <br>
        be myself around you, <br>
        make jokes with you, <br>
        because you will always be there, not judging how I act. <br>
        And that's why I love you so much. <br>
        <br>
        <div class="dividetop"><span>♥</span></div>
        <br>
        <i>I know we have only been together for a short time, <br>
        So I hope in our relationship we continue to climb, <br>
        Until our bond reaches such heights, <br>
        That it wont break, even in the darkest nights. <br>
        <br>
        I want you to know, <br>
        The most important in the world is you, <br>
        To me you're as important as to skiing there is snow, <br>
        Or as to saturation there is hue. <br>
        <br>
        I love you so so much, <br>
        It will be worth all the wait, <br>
        To at some day feel your touch, <br>
        Us in real life together, it will be great. <br>
        <br>
        I'm willing to do anything for us to stay, <br>
        And I'm glad we are a perfect match, <br>
        So let's keep it that way, <br>
        And promise to never close the latch. <br>
        <br>
        All though the distance between us stretches far, <br>
        You always light up my world, like the brightest star, <br>
        You're the flower to my empty vase, <br>
        So until the day I get to say, <br>
        "I love you", to your face, <br>
        <strong>Dear Sora, I'll always love you anyway.</strong> <br>
        <br>
        </i>
        <div class="dividebottom"><span>♥</span></div>
        <br>
        You are the most amazing person that I have ever met, and I am so grateful to have you in my life. I know sometimes we have our ups <br>
        and downs, but I want you to know that no matter what happens, <strong><i><br><div class="love-msg">I will always love you.</div></i></strong> <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
